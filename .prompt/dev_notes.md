Log 1: Did Copilot generate the full class? What did you need to fix? 
    Copitlot did generate the full class. I made minor fixes such asfixing indentation and adding more docstrings.

Log 2: What did Copilot get right or wrong about read-only attributes? 
    Copilot did make the read-only attrubute correct by adding a getter but no setter which prevents modification after initialization

Log 3: Did Copilot remember to call Employee when creating objects?
    Yes, Copilot did remember to call Employee when creating objects. Each row is passed to the employee class to create an object. I did not need to import fixes since the files are in the same directory.

Log 4: Which parts needed human fixes
   I added more user-friendly error messages or logging, especially for file I/O operations (e.g., handling missing or corrupt CSV files).

Log 6: Did Copilot try to put validation in the UI code instead of the class? If so, how did you fix it? 
    No, Copilot did not try to put validation in the UI code instead of the class. The  UI code in 'employeeApp.py' only collects input and passes it to the class.
